## Description

Dots are what define how your computer function and look aesthetically. They're like clothes, they
show who you are and your style. Unless your Danct, in which case your goal is to make your rice
as ugly as possible c;. In all seriousnes, feel free to take whatever you like from here, as I change
my themes around, I'll be sure to upload them here so you can find them.

## Organization
My dots are organized using a program called [Sequestrum](https://github.com/iiPlasma/sequestrum).
Highly suggest that dotfile manager since it has a lot of great features like modularity, custom 
package management, and a stellar config system. ~~Let's ignore the fact I wrote it~~.
